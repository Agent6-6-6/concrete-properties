- [x] Obtain ultimate stresses (using d_n to work out strains at nodes, then get stress)
- [x] Do the same thing for service stresses
- [x] Stress plot - add tricontour for zero stress only?
- [x] Add testing
  - [ ] Stresses for RCB tests
  - [ ] Rotation tests - rotate geometry & theta and check results are constant
  - [ ] Stress forces - check force equilibrium and desired moments
- [ ] Clean up profiles - maybe require that certain profiles may only be used for each material?
- [ ] Documentation!
  - [ ] Is there a way to generate output within a docstring??
