## Styleguide

If submitting a pull request, please follow the below style guide to ensure a smooth review and approval process.

### Python

All python code is linted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black). 

All classes, methods and functions must have docstrings capable of being interpreted by sphinx, documenting all parameters and outputs. Use typehints where possible. Refer to the existing code for examples.

All new code should have associated [tests](https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/concrete-properties/tree/master/concreteproperties/tests) where possible. Code coverage can be viewed [here](https://app.codecov.io/gh/robbievanleeuwen/concrete-properties).

### Documentation

New features in *concreteproperties* should be documented on the relevant pages. For example new stress-strain profiles should be added to the [Materials](https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/concrete-properties/blob/master/docs/source/rst/materials.rst) page and new design codes should be added to the [Design Codes](https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/concrete-properties/blob/master/docs/source/rst/design_codes.rst) page. Where possible and relevant, use sphinx directives to make links to classes, functions and methods mentioned in the documentation. Refer to the existing methods and classes to ensure consistent formatting and fluidity of the documentation.

Examples can be added by adding a ``jupyter notebook`` file to the [notebooks](https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/concrete-properties/tree/master/docs/source/notebooks) folder and referencing the file on the [Examples](https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/concrete-properties/blob/master/docs/source/rst/examples.rst) page. It is recommended that the documentation be built locally with ``make html`` prior to commiting to the pull request to ensure there are no build errors.
