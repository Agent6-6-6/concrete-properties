_concreteproperties_ is a python package that can be used to calculate the section
properties of arbitrary reinforced concrete sections. _concreteproperties_ can calculate
gross, cracked and ultimate properties. It can perform moment curvature analyses
and generate moment interaction and biaxial bending diagrams. On top of this,
_concreteproperties_ can also generate pretty stress plots!

Here's an example of some of the non-linear output _concreteproperties_ can generate:
