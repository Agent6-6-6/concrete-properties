# concreteproperties

Calculate section properties for reinforced concrete sections.


## To do:
- [ ] Expand material properties
  - [ ] Tensile strength
  - [ ] Residual shrinkage tensile stress

- [ ] Add concrete property calculations
  - [ ] Gross second moment of area (I_g)
  - [ ] Cracking moment (M_cr)
  - [ ] Cracked second moment of area (I_cr)
  - [ ] Effective second moment of area (I_ef)
  - [ ] Reporting of k_u

- [ ] Add stress calculations
  - [ ] Uncracked stresses
  - [ ] Cracked stresses
  - [ ] Stresses at ultimate

- [ ] Add code module
  - [ ] Codify calculation of material properties

- [ ] Add visualisation
  - [ ] Stress visualisation
  - [ ] Free body diagrams

- [ ] Expand to include prestressed concrete

- [ ] Exclude holes made by reinforcement in ultimate calculation
